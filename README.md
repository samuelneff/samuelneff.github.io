## Azurepath

A partner and I developed and ran Azurepath from 2013 through 2018. It was a sales-CRM SaaS product that brought significantly enhanced usability, workflow, and advanced analysis tools to the sales and customer management space. As the Co-Founder and Principal Software Engineer, I architected the application, chose the technologies to use, and implemented the majority of the work personally.
