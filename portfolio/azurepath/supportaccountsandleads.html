                         Accounts are typically companies or people you do business with or would like to do business with and are used to group and organize leads over time. <strong>Each lead requires a parent account</strong>. Accounts typically include information such as region, type, contacts, lead history, and communication history. However, some Azurepath users use Accounts as "buckets" for Leads that are largely unrelated. For example, to group a batch of new leads by lead source or import date. In this case, if a "bucket" lead turns into actual business, the lead can be moved to its own designated parent account to correctly track subsequent leads within a parent account. Leads are opportunities to make money within Accounts that will eventually be marked as closed won or lost. Leads typically include information such as value, estimated close date, contacts, contact touches, products and payment terms.

                         Accounts group and organize Lead information. If you do repeat business with a customer (i.e. you have multiple leads with them over time), that customer should have a dedicated account where leads are tracked and aggregated. If you have many leads that are new and unqualified, you should consider creating an account lead "bucket" to house the leads until they become true accounts (you can quickly move a lead from one account to another or create a new account using a lead's information as the starting point). The default account list view lists information about last touch date, satisfaction level (a value you assign that can be helpful to determine the health of your open leads or to quickly indicate reference clients), and information about total leads, open leads, the total value of open leads, and the total value of all closed won leads. You can filter Accounts by owner (using three bar filter button next to the main header), active (has open leads), inactive (doesn't have open leads), as well as by many useful time periods / activities. You can also filter accounts by letter of the alphabet. Search for accounts using the magnifying glass button in the main menu.

                         Leads group and organize business transactions with your Accounts. Any opportunity to make money within an account should be tracked as a lead. Lead's can be set to recur automatically to facilitate this process. Leads contain lead stage, value, contact, estimated close date, payment, communication history, product, and attachment information. To fully leverage Azurepath's insight and trends, three lead fields should always be filled out even if they are just estimates: <strong>lead stage</strong> (where the lead is in your selling process), <strong>value</strong> (how much the lead is potentially worth), and <strong>estimated close date</strong> (when you expect to win the business). You can filter Leads by owner (using three bar filter button next to the main header), or by filters such as open, won, lost, and many useful time periods / activities. Search for leads using the magnifying glass button in the main menu.

                    <p class="lead mb16">
                        There are three useful ways to keep all leads current in Azurepath. 
					</p>
                    <p class="lead mb16">
						<strong>First</strong>, you can add a touch to a lead and then add a reminder for yourself (or another member of the team) to follow up at a certain date and you'll receive an email on that date with the reminder note and a link to the lead. To add a reminder to a lead touch, click the alarm icon at the bottom of any lead touch, pick a date to be reminded on and if you want it to go to someone other than you, pick that name from the drop down.
					</p>
                    <p class="lead mb16">
						<strong>Second</strong>, In system setup / application choose when you a want to highlight a lead as out of touch and it will be highlighted red in the lead last touch column once it reaches your selection (after 60 days for example). Choosing to display last touch in your lead list and sorting by clicking on the column header is a great way to get a list of lead follow ups to complete that day.
					</p>
                    <p class="lead mb40">
						<strong>Third</strong>, use the trend chart "Leads by touch activity". Click on the small chart for a detailed view and click on any point in the chart to refine the list. You can click on a lead in the list and then the view icon to add a new touch to that lead and get them current again.

                    <h4 class="uppercase mb16">Custom Views</h4>
                    <p class="lead mb40">
                        Azurepath allows for highly customizable layouts. The light gray gear icon is for changing Account and Lead list column display options. Drag and drop column headers to reorder, hide or show Account and Lead information you deem important in the display window. Click Account or Lead list column headers to sort the list information by closing date (shown below), value, stage, etc. Use the light gray line "handles" between Account and Lead list column headers to resize your columns to best fit your screen width.

                    <h4 class="uppercase mb16">Adding Fields</h4>
                    <p class="lead mb40">
                        Azurepath encourages its users to leverage searchable and flexible Account and Lead tags for custom pieces of information but when a custom text field or drop down list is required, up to five are easy to add to both Accounts and Leads. Visit System Setup and click on the Account or Lead tab depending upon where you want the custom element to appear. Custom fields are located at the bottom left of System Setup Account and Lead tabs. The "T" icon is for text entry fields and the list icon is for drop down lists. Click to edit the text and reorder, add or remove list options as needed. Click "Done" in the main menu above and you're all set.

                    <h4 class="uppercase mb16">Batch Editing</h4>
                    <p class="lead mb40">
                        Azurepath allows you to batch edit leads. Click the edit button (pencil icon) located in the upper right corner of your leads list. Checkboxes will appear next to your leads. Hold down the shift key on your keyboard to select multiple leads in a row. Once you've made your batch editing selection, choose from the following batch edit options: lead stage, estimated close date, owner, parent account, boomerang or delete. Note that you can't access lead detail pages when in batch edit mode. Exit batch edit mode to access lead detail pages.

                    <p class="lead mb40">
                        Azurepath allows you to find virtually anything. Simply click the magnifying glass search button in the top menu bar to search by account, lead, contact, tags, touch note, custom field, and more. Click any search result to view the associated account or lead. You may also export any search list to Excel for reporting and sharing of information outside of Azurepath.

                    <p class="lead mb40">
                        Azurepath allows you to export any Account or Lead list to create a custom CSV or Excel report. Simply apply any filters you'd like to an Account or Lead list, click the export button, show/hide and reorder your report columns to create the report you want and click ok. You can even add detail sheets to your Excel report that focus on all touches, products, payments or contacts.
